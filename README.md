## What I Found Interesting
RAFT is a really cool consensus algorithm that solves a lot of problems regarding data integrity in maintaining a fault tolerant system. This website is really cool because it explains RAFT at a high level and has a lot of animations and diagrams to illustrate how RAFT works in real time. The animations can be sped up or slowed down helping people visualize the selection and election process of RAFT in different states. There are also a list of publications and videos/lectures one can watch on the bottom of the website.
## Sam's Comment 
I thought this was a super interesting article and I found the visualization to be super cool. The description of consensus algortihms as well as the plethora of lectures and further reading attached were all helpful in understanding RAFT. Data integrity is a pretty intriguing topic so this was a fun read.
